# Opening-Chess-Practice
The goal of this project is to help aspiring chess practitioners study their chess theory of openings. Chess.com and various other sites have environments that allow you to explore openings but they don't test you on your knowledge of main lines, you have to test yourself. So this application allows a user to test their knowledge in a more standardized way.

#### Technologies
This project is created using plain JS, HTML, and CSS and using the ABChess API version 0.3.0 (MIT License)

Currently running locally on VS Code live server
